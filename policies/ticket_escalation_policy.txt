Ticket Escalation Policy

1. Overview
This policy defines how customer support tickets are prioritized and escalated.

2. Priority Levels
- P1 (Critical): Service outage, security incident, or major financial impact.
- P2 (High): Severe functionality issues with no workaround.
- P3 (Medium): Degraded performance or minor feature issues.
- P4 (Low): General questions, minor UI issues, or requests for information.

3. Response Times
- P1: Initial response within 1 hour, 24/7.
- P2: Initial response within 4 business hours.
- P3: Initial response within 1 business day.
- P4: Initial response within 2 business days.

4. Escalation Rules
- If a P1 ticket is not resolved within 4 hours, it must be escalated to on-call engineering and a manager.
- If a P2 ticket is not resolved within 2 business days, escalate to the team lead.
- Any ticket can be escalated if there is significant customer dissatisfaction or regulatory impact.

5. Communication
All escalations must be documented in the ticket with:
- Reason for escalation.
- New owner or team.
- Next expected update time.

Support agents should keep customers informed until resolution.
